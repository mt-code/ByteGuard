		SELF-DISTRIBUTION (BYTEGUARD) README
=================================================================

This folder contains your protected application and any files that
were located within your specified application directory.

In this folder you should see a file named "ByteGuard_Protected.exe",
this is your original application after obfuscation. Any attempts
to open this file before a successful log-in will fail. Please do
not rename this file to ensure everything functions as expected.

In order to use your application, your customers will be required to
open the file named "ByteGuard_Login.exe" and create an account or
log-in to an existing account. After a successful login, your
application should automatically start and function as it did before
the ByteGuard protection was applied.
